Hi
I implemented this small project using localStorage and cookies.
In this way, product related data is stored in localStorage. Then, every time the page is loaded with this data, we receive and display the data from localStorage.
Also, cookies are used for the shopping cart section... when a product is added to the shopping cart, its data is stored in the cookies. The expiration time of this information is set to 30 days...
